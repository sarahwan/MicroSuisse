Design Decision Document
MicroSuisse - Grace Hseu, Sarah Wang

Our goal was to develop a framework for a highly configurable microsite where clients can 
consume interactive visual content.

Panel views - allows for easy and organized view of all provided data (four graphs)

Hidden sidebar - Creates an accessible navigation bar, which can be hidden to provide 
more room for the site content

Data list - toggle between different graphs of original data, allows for clients to access 
raw data with ease

Header - Title for informing page name

Footer - provides copyright and contact information for the developers

Trending and Model - pages added just for function purposes but no content implemented
